# Breast_Cancer_Detection
Generally cells in our body grow and divide to form new cells 
But in case of Breast cancer ,breast cells grow and divide uncontrollably to form a mass of tissue called tumour.
These cells can travel through other parts of the body to form new tumours.So these cells need to be removed from body as soon as possible.
If the breast cells that grow and divide untrollably are normal cells then it is begnin.
If the breast cells that grow and divide untrollably are abnormal cells then it is malignant
So in this project we are going to detect whether the cancer is benign or malignant
